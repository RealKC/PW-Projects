# PW Projects

This repository contains my two projects for my web programming course:

- under [Project1](Project1/), there is the first project I developed, which was an introductory project in web technologies for a theme of our own choosing
- under [Project2](Project2/), there is the second project I developed, which was a basic e-shop, with a small admin interface. We were to use a database for it, and I chose SQLite due to its simplicity.
